                            <br>
                            <h3>All This Design</h3>
                            The field of design goes far beyond the class I’m writing this for. It goes beyond writing software and fun new computer input/outputs. It goes beyond the creation of new products and services. Planning a marketing campaign involves design and implements design principles. Organizing an office space and mapping the workflow that will be carried out therein involves design and implements design principles. Even lifestyle decisions can be design projects consciously or otherwise. Drive or take the bus? What are the pros and cons? Try both and compare the results. Have you considered a bicycle? Is the bicycle a better choice but means you can’t dress quite to your office’s standard. Communicate the dilemma to your supervisor. There may be leeway. Design isn’t something designers do, it’s something we all do, all the time, and being conscious of design principles can mean we do all those things better. Our Design for Expression project was both an example of success and failure of this principle. We succeeded in by exploring the space of motion controls, looking at what was cutting edge, what was within the realm of a short project, what was fun and what was frustrating. We considered a slew of games for motion control, and considered the responses of others in this investigation. Unfortunately, this exploration of the problem space came somewhat at the expense of learning all we might have about the hardware. Missing key foibles about Leap Motion compatibility cost us days of development time.

                            <h2>It’s a Struggle</h2>
                            I’m generally not a hard sell on what we can call best practices in design. I took the Human-Computer Interaction class I am writing this article for because I wanted to get better at the iterative approach and project management and scrum and all these things. There are a few principles that seem self contradictory, but for the most part, I’ve bought in. I may not be good at these best practices, but I want to be, and I’m happy to advocate for them. But it’s not as easy as wanting to be better. I want to be better because this stuff is important. I also want to be better because I lack talent in these areas. One trick I’ve used effectively to compensate for this lack of talent is defining rules for myself. The following are a few rules I’ve identified, both in this class and before it.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <h2>So What Are My Design Principles?</h2>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Investigate</h3>
                            Investigating means learning everything you can. I’m big on gathering information. This would be the corporate espionage stage. Be a researcher; be a reporter; be a detective; be a spy. No one can know everything about a subject, and trying to gather too much information before a project even begins can mean wasting valuable development time. But even if this stage bleeds into the early development, it’s valuable to approach the matter of your project as if you’re a detective investigating a crime, or a reporter digging into a story. Getting the foundational facts in order, interviewing the people involved, hitting the books, and exploring leads that might be dead ends will both help you understand the problem you’re trying to solve and open up possibilities for creative solutions and new approaches that might never have occurred to the team.
                            <br>
                            <h3>Speed</h3>
                            The design team has to be a well oiled machine. The old model of designing in discrete stages, everything in order, with a finished product at the end is going obsolete. Today, all stages of design are happening almost simultaneously. It is expected that we are creating some form of prototype even as we are first learning what the project is supposed to be. The flip side of that is that we are still looking at new definitions of the problem space even as we are handing over designs to the client. Iterate is the name of the game, and with tight deadlines, the all important iterations can only happen if every member of the team begins and ends at a all out run. (May be why they’re called design sprints.) We’re college students. We’re busy. Sprinting for us means, more than anything, defeating our instincts to procrastinate. It is critical that we touch our projects every single day, several times a day, giving just as much attention as we can to multiple aspects of the design process: the prototyping, the sketching, communication with the client, user testing, documentation, communicating among the team, investigating the problem space, supporting your teammates. It’s a real challenge to keep that many balls in the air, to not spend too much time on one at the expense of the other. But it’s all this and more. And in this class, every single project reminded me of this principle. As our professor frequently reminded us, the course is effectively several courses worth of topics covered really quickly. We had four design sprints this semester, for an average of 3.5 weeks per sprint (some were two weeks). Doing everything required for the projects we were asked to create in that time was a challenge, and where we were able to follow the frenetic game plan above, we succeeded. Where we didn’t, we struggled.
                            <br>
                            <h3>Research</h3>
                            This I learned from marketing before I ever took a design class. Constantly gathering information on the effectiveness of your strategy could be called the key to a successful strategy, but it goes deeper than that. Planning your campaign as if you’re running an experiment is precisely how you tell the difference between a successful and unsuccessful strategy. Without this constant research, whether of not you are even seeing success is a mystery, let alone the key to that unknown success. Designing software cannot always be done as an a|b test, but the spirit of seeking feedback at every stage and every step of development is one I am always aspiring to improve upon in my own design strategy. This was most easily achieved in our Design for VR project. It turns out that Google Cardboard is very visible, portable, and novel to a lot of people. All I had to do was whip out the headset and my phone in the five minutes before any given class, and I had a line of people waiting to experience riding on a dragon’s back. Their awe as well as their motion sickness was easy to see and provided the most valuable feedback of our development cycle.
                            <br>
                            <h3>Leader/follower -ship</h3>
                            I saw a sign on a professor’s door recently. It admonished the reader to be a leader. I thought of Kant’s categorical imperative. I thought how we must judge an act on whether it could be extended universally without resulting in a contradiction. (Philosophy minor. Deal with it.) In order for a leader to exist, someone must be following that leader. Someone who follows is a follower, not a leader. So to extend the instruction to be a leader to everyone results in no one being a leader, because no one is following. In simpler, and probably racist terms, too many chiefs, not enough indians. It’s foolish to strive to always be a leader. A master chef is humbled when working in a garage. A mechanic is as a child in a laboratory. Instead, we should strive to know when we are being called upon to lead, and when we are being called upon to follow, and to be ready to fill either of those roles as needed. If no one is saying to do something that needs to be done, then that means it’s your job to say it. If someone is saying what needs to be done, your job is to do it. In my own projects this semester, this has meant, among other things, that I was the first to establish the necessary lines of communication. In three of our four projects, I created the git repository, the slack channel and shared the group drive folder. I did this because I knew we needed these things and no one else did it first. In that one case out of four, someone else did it first. In that case it would have caused confusion and irritation had I created alternate channels to those already established. In the other cases, it would have caused a delay to wait and debate where and how we wanted to communicate. We didn’t always make extensive use of each medium, but they were always available without delay.
                            <br>
                            <h3>Mistakes</h3>
                            “Everyone makes mistakes.” A saying so overused, it’s nearly worthless. But as many times as we’ve heard this, we still strive not to make mistakes. As if through sheer force of will, we can reverse this law of nature for ourselves alone. We’re wrong to try. Instead, we should be excited for our mistakes. Seeing how things break gives a deeper understanding than seeing how they work. Making many mistakes helps us to accept that we may be making one at any given moment. It helps us to let go of the ideas we have now, and move on to bigger and better mistakes. Mistakes are how we learn. Mistakes are the flip side of creativity. All design is a mistake until someone realizes the mistake was brilliant, and then claims that’s what they intended to do. In our Leap Motion project, my mistakes gave me an understanding of the hardware and its limitations that I could pass on to the team member who would have the stroke of genius that became our Overwatch controller. In our Data Visualization project, my error in using Tableau moved us in new directions of interest with the data set we had and other data sets we were exploring.
                            <br>
                            <h3>The Three C's</h3>
                            I have my own theories of management and teamwork. One of the most important revolves around three critical concepts of communication, each of which happens to begin with the letter C (because alliteration is fun). Be clear, be concise, and be consistent. In any professional setting, these rules will serve every team member well.
                            <h4><i>Be clear</i></h4>
                            The most obvious rule. Think about what you want to communicate and say it in a way that is challenging to misinterpret. Step outside yourself and think how the other person will receive it, how they might misunderstand, how their feelings reactions might obstruct the message. If the team needs someone to do something, tell them right away and make sure they know what they need to do. If you fail at this, all you’ve accomplished is a waste of everyone’s time and you’ve probably taken a step backwards with the added confusion. Part of what it means to be a member of a team comprised of all undergraduate students is that in many ways we are the blind leading the blind. It can be a challenge to communicate clearly concepts we ourselves don’t fully understand.
                            <h4><i>Be concise</i></h4>
                            Sometimes communication involves some degree of confrontation. Mostly that means nothing more than ensuring everyone agrees on how responsibilities are to be divvied up. Sometimes it means calling out a team member who isn’t pulling their weight. (I probably should have been called out a couple times this semester.) Whatever the degree, confrontation is not easy, and it’s a skill many of us share a serious lack of. One key to getting through it is brevity. Say what needs to be said and let it go. We often keep talking after the point has been made because we are desperately trying to ease the discomfort we feel in the situation, but watering down the point doesn’t benefit anyone. Whether it’s confrontation or just regular communication, the less words you can use and still convey the idea you want to get across will always make the message more clear.
                            <h4><i>Be consistent</i></h4>
                            Everyone has expectations of others involved in a project. It’s important for the team to know the expectations of the client. It’s important for the client to know what feedback and parameters they are to provide to the team. The team will have expectations for its members. Few things are more toxic to the culture of a team and the attendant stake holders than inconsistency. Changing how things are done without explanation, holding different people to different standards, allowing mood to dictate interactions with other members of the team — all these examples will breed an environment of everyone for themselves. Consistency builds trust. When people know what to expect, and are rewarded for participating as they are expected to, then they will, and the team will become that well oiled machine discussed above. If the rules change each day without warning, the team will crumble into a mass of paranoia. People are good at adapting to their environment, and it’s up to every member of the team to create an environment that rewards cohesive teamwork.

                            <h2>That’s All</h2>
                            There’s a lot out there on the subject of design. People much smarter than I am have thought a great deal about it. Just so, I hope the ideas I’ve presented and the contributions I’ve made to their explanations becomes part of the lens you use when thinking about the process of design. It’s half art, half rigorous science, and it’s challenging as hell. It also touches on everything you use and every decision you make. Find principles that work for you, and above all, apply them.
